    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a 47-year-old professional from the UK with a diverse background and a passion for lifelong learning. Having spent 20 years as a tradesman, I developed strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a hands-on approach to work. I am a very highly trained yoga teacher and practitioner of meditation. I have now transitioned into finance, I now trade futures while also working as a full stack developer. My focus is on taking on one project at a time, ensuring I provide tailored, high-quality service by working closely with clients without rushing. A former athlete with a deep love for sports, I am also an avid traveller, having visited over 40 countries, which has broadened my perspective and enhanced my adaptability in both personal and professional pursuits.</p>
